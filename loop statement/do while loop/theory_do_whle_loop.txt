The loop will always be executed at least once even if the condition is false.

first it try to do update and last one it will end the number of loop

syntax:
do {
code block;
}
while (condition);


example:

int a=10        -->logic start from 10
do              --> it try to do a new update
{
i++;           ---> increase number or update new data
}while(a<=20);   ---> loop end here / logic end here upto 20
